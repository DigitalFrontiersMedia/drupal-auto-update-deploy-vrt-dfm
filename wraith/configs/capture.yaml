# This is an example configuration provided by Wraith.
# Feel free to amend for your own requirements.
# ---
# This particular config is intended to demonstrate how
# to use Wraith in 'capture' mode, which is best suited to
# comparing a test and live version of the same website.
#
# `wraith capture capture.yaml`

##############################################################
##############################################################

# (required) The engine to run Wraith with. Examples: 'phantomjs', 'casperjs', 'slimerjs'
browser: "phantomjs"

# (required) The domains to take screenshots of.
domains:
  LIVE: "https://www.example.com"
  Test: "https://user:pass@test-example.pantheonsite.io"

# (required) The paths to capture. All paths should exist for both of the domains specified above.
imports: "spider_paths.yaml"

# A list of URLs to skip when spidering.
# Ruby regular expressions can be used, if prefixed with `!ruby/regexp` as defined in the YAML Cookbook.
# See http://www.yaml.org/YAML_for_ruby.html#regexps
spider_skips:

# (required) Screen widths (and optional height) to resize the browser to before taking the screenshot.
screen_widths:
  - 320
  - 640
  - 768
  - 1024
  - 1280
  - 1536

# (optional) JavaScript file to execute before taking screenshot of every path. Default: nil
#before_capture: 'javascript/disable_javascript--phantom.js'

# (required) The directory that your screenshots will be stored in
directory: 'wraith/shots'

# (optional) JavaScript file to execute before taking screenshot of every path. Default: nil
before_capture: '../../javascript/wait--phantom.js'

# (required) Amount of fuzz ImageMagick will use when comparing images. A higher fuzz makes the comparison less strict.
fuzz: '10%'

# (optional) The maximum acceptable level of difference (in %) between two images before Wraith reports a failure. Default: 0
threshold: 5

# (optional) Specify the template (and generated thumbnail sizes) for the gallery output.
gallery:
  template: 'slideshow_template' # Examples: 'basic_template' (default), 'slideshow_template'
  thumb_width:  200
  thumb_height: 200

# (optional) Choose which results are displayed in the gallery, and in what order. Default: alphanumeric
# Options:
#   alphanumeric - all paths (with or without a difference) are shown, sorted by path
#   diffs_first - all paths (with or without a difference) are shown, sorted by difference size (largest first)
#   diffs_only - only paths with a difference are shown, sorted by difference size (largest first)
# Note: different screen widths are always grouped together.
mode: diffs_only

# (optional) Choose to run Wraith in verbose mode, for easier debugging. Default: false
verbose: false

# (optional) Color to highlight the image diff. Default: 'blue'
highlight_color: red

# (optional) Set the number of threads to use when saving images. Raising this value can improve performance, but very high
# values can lead to server connection issues. Set to around 1.5 the available CPU cores for best performance. Default: 8
threads: 8
